For the introduction of your paper on using evidence-based accumulation to understand foraging theory, you should consider discussing both foundational theories and recent advancements that bridge the gap between decision-making processes and foraging behavior. Here are some papers and themes you might explore:

1. **Foraging Theory Foundations**:
    
    - Introduce the Marginal Value Theorem (MVT) and its significance in foraging theory. Discuss the original premise of MVT by Charnov (1976) and how it has been applied to understand animal behavior in natural foraging contexts.
    
1. **Evidence Accumulation Models**:
    
    - Discuss the principles of evidence accumulation models as they apply to decision-making, highlighting their use in cognitive and systems neuroscience. Reference models like the Drift Diffusion Model (DDM) and how they have been used to model decision-making under uncertainty.
    
1. **Integration of Foraging Theory and Evidence Accumulation**:
    
    - Davidson and El Hady (2018) present a model where foraging decisions, specifically patch-leaving decisions, are formulated as an evidence accumulation process. This model adapts evidence accumulation models to the context of foraging, suggesting that animals accumulate noisy measurements to estimate the current patch's state and the overall environment. This paper provides a quantitative connection between ecological models of foraging behavior and evidence accumulation models of decision making, which could be a cornerstone reference for your paper [(Davidson & El Hady, 2018)](https://consensus.app/papers/foraging-evidence-accumulation-process-davidson/80bc8573db245df38be27b3db1fb5773/?utm_source=chatgpt).

1. **Applications and Future Directions**:
    
    - Explore how evidence accumulation models can enhance our understanding of foraging behavior beyond traditional MVT predictions, especially in uncertain environments. Discuss potential applications of these integrated models in understanding human decision-making, as well as implications for artificial intelligence and robotics.

5. **Challenges and Limitations**:
    
    - Address the current limitations of applying evidence accumulation models to foraging theory and the challenges of empirically testing these models. Discuss the need for experimental designs that can capture the dynamics of foraging decisions in real-time and the potential for neurobiological research to uncover the mechanisms underlying these processes.

6. **Think About**:
    
    - How can evidence accumulation models be further adapted to account for the complexities of natural foraging scenarios, such as social foraging, predation risk, and resource variability?
    - What are the implications of these models for conservation biology, behavioral ecology, and the management of natural resources?
Foraging is a ubiquitous animal behaviour, seen in all animals from fish to reptiles [4].

Optimal foraging is essential to the survival of not only the individual but the species itself. Thus the importance of understanding foraging theory is a bridge to understanding a part of our survival and evolution. 
Foraging theory concerns activities related to the acquisition of food [12]. It addresses decisions  
regarding (i) where to search, (ii) when to feed, (iii) which food types to consume, and (iv) when  
to terminate feeding and move on [15]. This project focuses on (iv) when to terminate and move  
on. This understanding of deciding when to leave extends to many decisions, across economic,  
political, and social spheres [10]. Therefore, its importance supersedes its direct relevance to  
foraging.  
Although this ecological behaviour has been extensively studied, it is not known how the brain  
processes information obtained during foraging activity to make subsequent foraging decisions  
[4]. Theoretical work has been conducted to find the optimal times to leave a patch using  
models like the marginal value theorem based purely on rewards that model food intake within  
patches. However, this project aims to fill this void, using evidence-based accumulation to  
evaluate optimal patch residency times.
